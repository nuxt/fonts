title: Providers
description: Font providers are designed to be pluggable and extensible, so no matter your setup you should be able to use an existing provider or write your own.

## Built-In Providers

Nuxt Fonts ships with a number of built-in providers.

### `local`

The local provider deeply scans your `public/` directories (including of your layers) for font files (supporting `ttf`, `woff`, `woff2`, `eot` or `otf` extensions).

Then, when you use a `font-family` in your CSS, we check to see whether it matches one of these files. By default, we expect the font file to be the `400` weight, `normal` style, and `latin` subset. To indicate different weights and styles, please include that information in the filename. For example `comic-sans-ms.woff2` (400/normal/latin; defaults), `comic-sans-ms-700-italic-cyrillic.woff2` (700/italic/cyrillic). Keywords like `light`, `bold`, or `black` are accepted in place of a weight number: `comic-sans-ms-bold.woff2`. `font-family` values with spaces and/or caps will lookup hyphenated lowercase filenames as well, eg `font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'` will look for `comic-sans-ms.woff2` as well as `Comic\ Sans\ MS.woff2` on disk.

Please note that the local provider will only attempt to load styles and weights that were configured in the [Font Options](./2.configuration.md#font-options).

### `google`

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is one of the best known public font APIs.

### `googleicons`

[Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) adds support for Material Symbols and Material Icons.

### `bunny`

[Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/) is provided by [bunny.net](https://bunny.net/) and is a drop-in Google Fonts compatible API, focusing on privacy.

### `fontshare`

[Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/) is a free font service with 100+ professional-grade fonts from the Indian Type Foundry (ITF).

::callout
You should read [their terms in full](https://www.fontshare.com/licenses/itf-ffl) before using a font through `fontshare`.
::

### `fontsource`

[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/introduction) is a collection of open-source fonts that are designed for self-hosting in web applications.

### `adobe`

[Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/) is a font service for both personal and commercial use included with Creative Cloud subscriptions.

To configure the Adobe provider in your Nuxt app, you must provide a Project ID or array of Project IDs corresponding to the Web Projects you have created in Adobe Fonts.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/fonts'],
  fonts: {
    adobe: {
      id: ['<some-id>', '<another-kit-id>'],
    },
  }
})
```

::callout{type=warning}
We currently can't provide non-latin subsets for Adobe Fonts as they do not have a public API for that. Please use other providers in such cases.

::callout{type=warning}
You should read [their terms in full](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html) before using a font through `adobe`.

## Custom Providers

The core of the provider API in Nuxt Fonts has been extracted to a common library that can be used by any framework - [`unifont`](https://github.com/unjs/unifont).

The provider API is likely to evolve in the next few releases of `unifont`, but at the moment it looks like this:

```ts
import { defineFontProvider } from 'unifont'

export default defineFontProvider('some-custom-provider', async (options) => {
  // do some setup
  return {
    async resolveFont (fontFamily, options) {
      if (fontFamily === 'My Font Family') {
        return {
          fonts: [
            {
              src: [
                { url: 'https://cdn.org/my-font.woff2', format: 'woff2' },
              ],
              weight: 400,
              style: 'normal',
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Module authors can also add their own providers (or remove existing ones) in the `fonts:providers` hook which is called by Nuxt Fonts after all modules have run.

```ts
nuxt.hook('fonts:providers', providers => {
  delete providers.adobe

  providers['custom-provider'] = defineFontProvider('custom-provider', async () => {
    /** some setup */
    return {
      async resolveFont (fontFamily, options) {
        /** resolve font faces */
      }
    }
  })
})
```
