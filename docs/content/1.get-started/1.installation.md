---

## Automatic Installation
Add `@nuxt/fonts` dependency to your project:
```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add fonts
```

## Manual Installation
::code-group
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm i @nuxt/fonts
  ```
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn add @nuxt/fonts
  ````
  ```bash [npm]
  npm i @nuxt/fonts
  ```
::

Add it to `modules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/fonts',
  ]
})
```

You can now start using by adding `font-family` declarations to your CSS now. âœ¨

::callout
If you haven't done so, please add `.data` directory to your `.gitignore` file.
::

## Configuration

Nuxt Fonts works out of the box with zero configuration, but for a finer-grained control, please consider adding a `fonts` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
fonts: {
  // Options
}
```

::callout
Checkout the [fonts configuration](/get-started/configuration) for all available options and features to customize.
::

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation:

- Ensure that you are using LTS version of NodeJS ([NodeJS Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

- Try to upgrade to latest versions:

  ::code-group
    ```bash [pnpm]
    pnpm up @nuxt/fonts
    ```

    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn upgrade @nuxt/fonts
    ```

    ```bash [npm]
    npm up @nuxt/fonts
    ```
  ::

- Try recreating lock-file:

  ```bash
  npx nuxt@latest upgrade --force
  ```

- Check your network connection. Your machine might be having a hard time communicating with the providers.

- If none of the above worked, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues) and include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
