title: Providers
description: Font providers are designed to be pluggable and extensible, so no matter your setup you should be able to use an existing provider or write your own.

## Built-In Providers

Nuxt Fonts ships with a number of built-in providers.

### `local`

The local provider deeply scans your `public/` directories (including of your layers) for font files (supporting ttf, woff, woff2, eot or otf extensions).

Then, when you use a `font-family` in your CSS, we check to see whether it matches one of these files. We also expect font weight, font style and subset to be in the file name, unless they are 'default' values (`400` weight, `normal` style and `latin` subset).

### `google`

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is one of the best known public font APIs.

### `bunny`

[Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/) is provided by [bunny.net](https://bunny.net/) and is a drop-in Google Fonts compatible API, focusing on privacy.

### `fontshare`

[Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/) is a free font service with 100+ professional-grade fonts from the Indian Type Foundry (ITF).

You should read [their terms in full](https://www.fontshare.com/licenses/itf-ffl) before using a font through `fontshare`.

### `fontsource`

[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/introduction) is a collection of open-source fonts that are designed for self-hosting in web applications.

### `adobe`

[Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/) is a font service for both personal and commercial use included with Creative Cloud subscriptions.

To configure the Adobe provider in your Nuxt app, you must provide a Project ID or array of Project IDs corresponding to the Web Projects you have created in Adobe Fonts.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/fonts'],
  fonts: {
    adobe: {
      id: ['<some-id>', '<another-kit-id>'],
    },
  }
})
```

::callout{type=warning}
We currently can't provide non-latin subsets for Adobe Fonts as they do not have a public API for that. Please use other providers in such cases.

You should read [their terms in full](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html) before using a font through `adobe`.

## Custom Providers

The provider API is likely to evolve in the next few releases of Nuxt Fonts, but at the moment it looks like this:

```ts
import { defineFontProvider } from '@nuxt/fonts/utils'

export default defineFontProvider({
  async setup () {
    // do some setup
  },
  async resolveFontFaces (fontFamily, defaults) {
    if (fontFamily === 'My Font Family') {
      return {
        fonts: [
          {
            src: [
              { url: 'https://cdn.org/my-font.woff2', format: 'woff2' },
              // this will be inferred as a `woff` format file
              'https://cdn.org/my-font.woff',
            ],
            weight: 400,
            style: 'normal',
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Module authors can also add their own providers (or remove existing ones) in the `fonts:providers` hook which is called by Nuxt Fonts after all modules have run.

```ts
nuxt.hook('fonts:providers', providers => {
  providers.push({
    async setup () {
      /** some setup */
    },
    async resolveFontFaces (fontFamily, defaults) {
      /** resolve font faces */
    }
  })
})
```
